# TwitterBot
A bot that tells you how long till Christmas!

## Call it!
Simply make a [tweet](https://twitter.com/compose/tweet) with the tag `#krismas` and [Krismas](https://twitter.com/krismas_1) will reply telling you how many days till Christmas (in about 15 seconds).

## How tho?
[Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org) is a python library that makes it easy to use the [Twitter Api](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api). By supplying the necessary keys and tokens you can use twitter api to retrieve the tweets with the specific hashtag and reply to them.

## Make your own!
This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0wWwglE1Vc) is quite old but the fundamentals are still very useful.

## Special thanks
Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you my friends for helping me test the bot!
